==== Simple Pin-tool based simulator to evaluate emerging memory technologies ====


== Preparation ==

To compile the simulator with Pin-tool, in theory you only have to run

	make

The Makefile script will see that you don't have the Pin tool installed,
so it will download and prepare one for you.
After that, it will proceed and compile the simulator.

== Run a simulation ==

I run simulations like this:

	make && ./pin/pin -t obj-intel64/nvramsim.so -- <command>

After this, the following outputs will be created:

	nvramsim_stats_<PROCESS-ID>.txt
	stats_cache.txt
	{stderr} output with some CSV statistics


== Workloads preparation ==

You should prepare the workloads once, before running the first simulation ever.
Preparation includes downloading and/or generating some input files.

To prepare the workloads, run the following command:

	./workloads_prepare


== Workload execution ==

I executed the following workloads:

Compression of a large tiff image:

	make && ./pin/pin -t obj-intel64/nvramsim.so -- gzip workloads/hs-2006-10-a-hires_tif.tif -c >/dev/null

Compression of a large jpeg image:

	make && ./pin/pin -t obj-intel64/nvramsim.so -- gzip workloads/isaac_tmo_2012241_lrg.jpg -c >/dev/null
